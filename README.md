# ü§ñ GenAI-Powered Resume Optimizer

This project is a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to function as an AI resume assistant. It leverages a powerful language model and a semantic search pipeline to automate the complex task of tailoring a resume to a specific job description.



## ‚ú® Features

* **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Automatically rewrites profile summaries and suggests tailored, action-oriented bullet points based on the job description.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses a FAISS vector store built from the job description to ground all suggestions in facts, preventing hallucinations and ensuring relevance.
* **Deep Semantic Analysis:** Identifies critical skill gaps between the resume and the role, providing a justified match score.
* **Built-in Explainability:** Generates a step-by-step reasoning trace for every AI suggestion to ensure transparency and user trust.
* **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that supports PDF/DOCX uploads and allows users to download the final analysis report.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **AI Framework & Pipeline:** LangChain
* **Generative LLM:** Groq Llama 3 / Google Gemini (via API)
* **Embedding & Retrieval:** Hugging Face Sentence-Transformers (Local), FAISS
